DESCRIPTION
-----------
This archive contains an ANSI C library implementing bitwise reading and
writing for sequential files.  This library is intended to be easy to follow
and expand upon, though it may be used without an understanding of its
implementation.

FILES
-----
bitfile.c       - Library implementing bitwise reading and writing for
                  sequential files.
bitfile.h       - Header for bitfile library.
sample.c        - Program demonstrating how to use the bitfile library. 
LICENSE         - GNU Lesser General Public License
Makefile        - makefile for this project (assumes gcc compiler and GNU make)
README          - this file

BUILDING
--------
To build these files with GNU make and gcc, simply enter "make" from the
command line.

USAGE
-----
sample.c demonstrates usage of each of the bitfile functions.

HISTORY
-------
01/30/04 - Initial release
06/14/04 - Use incomplete type to hide definition of bitfile structure
11/09/04 - Added a routine to convert an open bitfile_t to a FILE.
           Added a routine to align a bitfile to the next byte.

TODO
----
- Consider adding extra count so that files ending in incomplete bytes
  may be appended to starting with the incomplete byte instead of the
  next whole byte.
- Test on platforms with character lengths other than 8 bits.
